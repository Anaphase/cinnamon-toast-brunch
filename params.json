{"name":"Cinnamon Toast Brunch","tagline":"A Brunch skeleton utilizing AngularJS, CoffeeScript, Stylus, & SIML.","body":"Cinnamon Toast Brunch\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/i8UyOKN.png)\r\n\r\n**Never write a semicolon again!** With [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), & [SIML](https://github.com/padolsey/SIML), you get clean, easy to read code that compiles down to plain ol' JavaScript, CSS, & HTML.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy behind Cinnamon Toast Brunch is to write as little code as possible. That means not having to bother with needless semicolons, curly braces, commas, colons, and (worst of all) angle brackets and other assorted HTML visual clutter.\r\n\r\nWith Cinnamon Toast Brunch, your code is clean and concise. Of course, if you're a fan of writing lots of extra punctuation with your code, **you can still use vanilla JavaScript and CSS in place of CoffeeScript and Stylus** to write all the semicolons you want. Also, because Bootstrap is also included, there's additional LESS support for those of you who are somewhere in the middle ;)\r\n\r\nOh yeah, only [Bootstrap's](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) CSS is included, none of the JavaScript plugins. See [UI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) for an AngularJS port of Bootstrap's JavaScript.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nMake sure to have [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) installed.\r\n\r\nCreate your project using Cinnamon Toast Brunch with:\r\n\r\n\tbrunch new <your-project-name> -s github://Anaphase/cinnamon-toast-brunch\r\n\r\nOr simply copy the repository to your hard drive and rename it.\r\n\r\nSample Project\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nA simple todo app is included as a sort of boiler plate. The app demonstrates basic use of controllers, directives, filters, and services so it should give you a good idea of how to structure your new project.\r\n\r\n### App Structure\r\n\r\n```\r\napp\r\n  app.coffee\r\n  assets\r\n    images\r\n      // just Bootstrap's icons in here\r\n    index.html // holds the ng-view to display your templates\r\n    js\r\n      json3.js // JSON.stringify polyfill for AngularJS's IE support\r\n  partials\r\n    footer.siml\r\n  scripts\r\n    controllers.coffee\r\n    directives.coffee\r\n    filters.coffee\r\n    services.coffee\r\n  styles\r\n    styles.styl\r\n  templates\r\n    home.siml\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Automatic Router Generation via siml-angular-brunch\r\n\r\nCinnamon Toast Brunch uses [siml-angular-brunch](http://github.com/Anaphase/siml-angular-brunch) to compile your SIML and inject the templates into the `$templateCache`. siml-angular-brunch can also optionally generate a simple AngularJS router for you. See [the documentation](https://github.com/Anaphase/siml-angular-brunch/blob/master/README.md#optional-router-generation) for details on how to enable and configure the router.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomize Bootstrap\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nAll Bootstrap stylesheet files can be found separated into `vendor/styles/bootstrap`. They're in the original [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) format in order to be easily customized and compiled together with the app build.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Colin Wood\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
